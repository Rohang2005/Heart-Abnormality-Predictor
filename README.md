This Project is made using machine learning modules to predict wether a person has abnormalities in his or her heart by taking in data related to the patient such as age, sex, ECG value, etc. The python libraries used include Numpy, Pandas Sklearn.metrics, Sklearn.linear_model, Sklearn.model_selection. The type of regression used is Logistic Regression and the training and testing dataset is split as 80-20. The pre-existing data set is pulled from kaggle in the form of a csv file. The training dataset has an accuracy of 87% and the testing dtaset has an accuracy of 83%. The csv file is first read using the pandas library, after this the data is split into training and test data in on the scall of 0.2(80 to 20).After the data is split, it is trained and fitted using logistic regression then the data is used to predict the state of the heart of the patient with the details that have been entered by the user.
